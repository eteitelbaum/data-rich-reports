You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website."

Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File > New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto."

In this course we will learn to use GitHub to store, manage and collaborate on code.\nOne central concept you want to be familiar with is a repository or “repo” for short. Repos are essentially folders where code can be stored and then accessed and changed by multiple users. All of the assignments for this course will be managed in repos.\nGitHub repos are managed using a version control system named Git. Git allows developers to make and track changes to the code stored in the repo. Git also enables users to create branches to work on the code without affecting the main codebase and then merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.\nThe first thing you are going to want to do is to register a GitHub account. From there, you want to install Git and initiate Git using the usethis package.\nNext, you need to generate a personal access token (PAT) and set your credentials with the gitcreds package.\nNow, you can create a GitHub repo and clone it to your computer in RStudio. There a number of ways to clone a repo, but the recommended method for this course involves creating a new project in RStudio and selecting “Version Control” for the method (instead of “New Directory” as we did before). From there, select “Git”, copy the URL from the green “Code” tab in the GitHub repo, and paste it into “Repository URL” field. Next, select the directory where you want the repository to be created and click “create project.”"

    "text": "Step 3: Reshape the data\n\nThere are a few things about the data here that make it messy. First, in order for the data to be tidy, we want each column to represent a variable and each row to represent an observation.\nBut here we see the reverse: the data are in wide form, meaning that each column represents a year and each row represents a country. This entails that each row represents multiple observations in that we have data for multiple years for each row.\nTo rectify this, we need to reshape the data from wide form to long form. For this, we need the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package.\nThe pivot_longer() function takes three basic arguments:\n\ncols - which columns you want to pivot\nnames_to - what you want the column with the transposed data to be called\nvalues_to - what you want the column with the values from the transposed data to be called\n\nIn our case, we want to reshape all of the year columns and have the years represented in the rows. We want the newly created column to be called “year” and the values are going to represent the data on female labor force participation we downloaded (flfp).\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nwb_data <- wb_data_messy |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = `1972 [YR1972]`: `2021 [YR2021]`, \n    names_to = \"year\", \n    values_to = \"flfp\"\n  ) \n\nglimpse(wb_data)\n\nRows: 11,100\nColumns: 6\n$ `Country Name` <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanist…\n$ `Country Code` <chr> \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\",…\n$ `Series Name`  <chr> \"Labor force participation rate, female (% of female po…\n$ `Series Code`  <chr> \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.…\n$ year           <chr> \"1972 [YR1972]\", \"1973 [YR1973]\", \"1974 [YR1974]\", \"197…\n$ flfp           <chr> \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pipe Operator\n\n\n\nFor our pivot-longer() call we used R’s native pipe operator. Pipes tell R to do something to the object that they are attached to. In this case, we are telling R to apply pivot_longer() to wb_data. The alternative way of writing this code would be to include the data as the first argument in the function, e.g. pivot_longer(wb_data, cols = ..., names_to = ... , values_to = ...). As you will see, pipe operators enable us to string together multiple functions in a convenient way to transform our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces in Variable Names\n\n\n\nNotice that when we specify the years in our pivot_longer() call we encapsulate them in backticks (``). This is because the years, as they were imported from the WDI dataset, have spaces in them. Typically we want to avoid this scenario by writing our variable names in snake_case."

Luckily there are some pretty good R packages that allow us to extract data from open source APIs. We are going to be working with two of those in this module (wbstats and vdemdata) and some others later in the course.\nAlong the way, we are going to continue to extend our data wrangling skills. We will learn some new functions in dplyr and janitor that will help us get our data into a usable form for analysis. We are also going to cover in depth some common data science workflows, including filtering observations, selecting variables, merging two data sets, summarizing data for different groups, and sorting data based on column values.\nThe end goal is to have a nice dataset with a combination of World Bank and V-Dem Institute data that we can use to illustrate the relationship between the economy, democracy and women’s empowerment."

    "text": "Filter observations, select and create new variables\n\nThe next thing we want to talk about is how to filter observations and to select new variables. We also delve more into the topic of how to create new variables. To illustrate these concepts, we are going to be working with the V-Dem Dataset. The V-Dem offers an R package for downloading its data called vdemdata.\nvdemdata is perfect for illustrating the filter() and select() verbs because its main function for downloading the data (vdem) does not take any arguments (it simply downloads the whole dataset). So you have to use R functions to narrow down the variables and years you want to work with.\nWhile V-Dem has wealth of indicators related to democracy, we are going to focus on the most famous one called the “polyarchy” score. We are also going to download data on per capita GDP and create some indicator variables for region that we will use later on when we summarize the data. Along with those variables, we also want to retain country_name, year and country_id for the purposes of merging these data with our World Bank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile V-Dem has a variable look-up tool (find_var), it does not provide very much information on the variables that the search function returns. Therefore, if you want to use this package for your own research, I highly recommend just going to the V-Dem codebook and manually grabbing the codes for the indicators that you want to use in your analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to filtering out years and selecting variables, let’s also create a region coding to facilitate our analysis later on. We will do this by piping in a mutate() call where we use the case_match() function to change the region from a numeric variable to a string. This will come in handy when we go to visualize the data in future lessons.\nWe will store our new data as an object called democracy.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data\n\n# Download the data\ndemocracy &lt;- vdem |&gt; # download the V-Dem dataset\n  filter(year &gt;= 1990)  |&gt; # filter out years less than 1990\n  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables\n    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  \n    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name\n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, \n    region = e_regionpol_6C\n    ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with country names\n                     1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                     2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                     3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                     4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                     5 ~ \"The West\", \n                     6 ~ \"Asia\")\n                    # number on the left of the ~ is the V-Dem region code\n                    # we are changing the number to the country name on the right\n                    # of the equals sign\n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 5,667\nColumns: 6\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.416, 0.439, 0.456, 0.473, 0.485, 0.513, 0.548, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…"

    "section": "Merge two datasets",
    "text": "Merge two datasets\n\nNow that we have a common country code, we can join the two data sets. There are many different types of joins. First there is a distinction between mutating joins, which add observations from one dataset to another, and filtering joins, which filter out observations based on their presence or absence in another dataset. Here we are going to be focused on mutating joins.\nThere are four kinds of mutating joins we can do in dplyr. An inner_join() keeps only the observations that are common in both datasets that you want to merge. A full_join() does the opposite. It keeps all of the observations present in both datasets regardless of whether or not they have a match. A left_join() keeps all of the observations in dataset \\(x\\) and only the matching observations in dataset \\(y\\). A right_join() does the same thing, but instead keeps all of the observations from dataset \\(y\\) and only matching observations from dataset \\(x\\).\nWe are going to use left_join() to merge our two datasets. left_join() takes three essential arguments: \\(x\\); \\(y\\); and \\(by\\) which identifies the column that we want to join on. For this exercise, the \\(x\\) dataset is going to be the democracy dataset, the \\(y\\) dataset is the women empowerment dataset, and we want to join on both the “iso3c” and “year” columns.\nWhen dplyr does a join, it renames any duplicate columns with suffixes like .x or .y. In our data, country is a duplicate column across the democracy and women’s empowerment datasets. So dplyr renames these country.x and country.y. It doesn’t really matter which one we keep, so let’s just rename country.x to country and filter out country.y using select().\nWe can can pipe all of these functions together and store the resulting data frame in a new object called dem_women. Let’s also save these data as a .csv file for future use with write_csv(). The first argument for write_csv() is the name of the data frame or tibble that we want to save. The second argument is the path and name of the file that we want to save it to.\n\n# Load readr\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Perform left join using common iso3c variable and year\ndem_women &lt;- left_join(democracy, women_emp, by = c(\"iso3c\", \"year\")) |&gt; \n  rename(country = country.x) |&gt; # rename country.x\n  select(!country.y)             # crop country.y\n\n# Save as .csv for future use\nwrite_csv(dem_women, \"data/dem_women.csv\")\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(dem_women)  \n\nRows: 5,667\nColumns: 9\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ iso3c        &lt;chr&gt; \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"…\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.416, 0.439, 0.456, 0.473, 0.485, 0.513, 0.548, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…\n$ women_rep    &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 14.20, 17.40, 18.20, 16.00, 1…\n$ flfp         &lt;dbl&gt; 33.94, 34.24, 35.01, 35.85, 36.38, 37.62, 37.69, 39.65, 3…"

    "text": "Downloading data from an API\n\nYou will no doubt remember the messy data that we downloaded from the World Bank’s website in module 1.1. Usually it is much easier to download data from an API as opposed to wrangling it from a .csv file. In this example, I want to illustrate that for you by having you download the same data that we worked with in the last module using the wbstats package.\nFirst we are going to load wbstats along with dplyr and janitor. The wb_data() function is the one we need to download the data from the World Bank’s API. wb_data() requires to main sets of arguments: a list of indicators that we want to use and the period for which we want to download data. The period can can be entered as two separate arguments (e.g. start_date and end_date). But for this exercise we will specify the number of years we want to download using mrv which stands for “most recent value.”\nIn addition to female labor force participation, let’s also grab the percentage of seats in parliament held by women. We will store that list of objects in a vector called women_emp to signify that these indicators are related to women’s empowerment. We will try to download 50 years of data for these two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to search World Bank data for additional indicators, you can use the wb_search() function. For example, if we wanted to find all of the indicators associated with female labor force participation, we could run:\n\nflfp_indicators &lt;- wb_search(\"female labor force\") # store the list of indicators\n\nprint(flfp_indicators, n=26) # view the indicators\n\nTry searching for some indicators related to a topic you are interested in and see what you get!\n\n\nWhile we are calling wb_data we will go ahead and pipe some additional functions from dplyr and janitor to clean it up. First, we will use select() to eliminate the iso2c variable, which we won’t be needing. Then, we will rename date to year. Then we will use a combination of mutate and round_to_fraction() to round the data to the nearest hundredth.\nWe will pipe all of these functions together and store the resulting data frame in a new object called women_emp.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(wbstats) # for downloading WB data\nlibrary(dplyr) # for selecting, renaming and mutating\nlibrary(janitor) # for rounding\n\n# Store the list of indicators in an object\nindicators &lt;- c(\"flfp\" = \"SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\", \"women_rep\" = \"SG.GEN.PARL.ZS\") \n\n# Download the data  \nwomen_emp &lt;- wb_data(indicators, mrv = 50) |&gt; # download data for last 50 yrs\n  select(!iso2c) |&gt; # drop the iso2c code which we won't be using\n  rename(year = date) |&gt; # rename date to year \n  mutate(\n    flfp = round_to_fraction(flfp, denominator = 100), # round to nearest 100th\n    women_rep = round_to_fraction(women_rep, denominator = 100) \n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(women_emp) \n\nRows: 6,944\nColumns: 5\n$ iso3c     &lt;chr&gt; \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW\", \"ABW…\n$ country   &lt;chr&gt; \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba…\n$ year      &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, …\n$ women_rep &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ flfp      &lt;dbl&gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n\n\nNow we have some pretty tidy World Bank data related to women’s empowerment without having to do too much work. I am sure you would agree that this is a much more straightforward process than downloading the data and then importing the data as a flat file!\nOne thing that becomes very clear here is that wb_data() did not download any data before 1990. It automatically filtered out the years for which all countries had no data. The fact there were no data before 1990 for any of the countries is easily missed when we were simply importing it from a .csv file."

    "text": "Reshaping data\n\nThere are a few things about the data here that make it messy. First, in order for the data to be tidy, we want each column to represent a variable and each row to represent an observation.\nBut here we see the reverse: the data are in wide form, meaning that each column represents a year and each row represents a country. This entails that each row represents multiple observations in that we have data for multiple years for each row.\nTo rectify this, we need to reshape the data from wide form to long form. For this, we need the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package.\nThe pivot_longer() function takes three basic arguments:\n\ncols - which columns you want to pivot\nnames_to - the name of the column where the old column names are going to\nvalues_to - the name of the column where the values are going to\n\nIn our case, we want to reshape all of the year columns and have the years represented in the rows. We want the newly created column to be called “year” and the values are going to represent the data on female labor force participation we downloaded (flfp).\n\n# Load tidyr\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Reshape the data\nwb_data <- wb_data_messy |> # take wb_data_messy, and put it in wb_data, but first...\n  pivot_longer(             # pivot the data from wide to long form\n    cols = `1972 [YR1972]`: `2021 [YR2021]`, # columns to pivot\n    names_to = \"year\", # name the first column \"year\"\n    values_to = \"flfp\" # name the second column \"flfp\"\n  ) \n\n# View the data\nglimpse(wb_data)\n\nRows: 11,100\nColumns: 6\n$ `Country Name` <chr> \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanist…\n$ `Country Code` <chr> \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\", \"AFG\",…\n$ `Series Name`  <chr> \"Labor force participation rate, female (% of female po…\n$ `Series Code`  <chr> \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.FE.ZS\", \"SL.TLF.ACTI.…\n$ year           <chr> \"1972 [YR1972]\", \"1973 [YR1973]\", \"1974 [YR1974]\", \"197…\n$ flfp           <chr> \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"..\", \"…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pipe Operator\n\n\n\nFor our pivot-longer() call we used R’s native pipe operator, e.g. |>. Pipes tell R to do something to the object that they are attached to. In this case, we are telling R to apply pivot_longer() to wb_data. The alternative way of writing this code would be to include the data as the first argument in the function, e.g. pivot_longer(wb_data, cols = ..., names_to = ... , values_to = ...). As you will see, pipe operators enable us to string together multiple functions in a convenient way to transform our data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpaces in Variable Names\n\n\n\nNotice that when we specify the years in our pivot_longer() call we encapsulate them in backticks (``). This is because the years, as they were imported from the WDI dataset, have spaces in them. Typically we want to avoid this scenario by writing our variable names in snake_case."

    "text": "Add country codes to a data frame\n\nOne common problem scholars face when they want to analyze country-level data is the fact that datasets use different country codes. This can make it challenging to combine datasets, thus limiting the potential scope of our analysis. Lucikly, there is a wonderful package called countrycode that can help to solve this problem.\nThe countrycode() function creates a new country code variable in our dataset that matches the country code variable of the second dataset that we are trying to merge it to. countrycode() takes three arguments: sourcevar; origin; and destination. sourcevar identifies the name of the column that you want to transform, origin is the coding system that you want to translate from, and destination is the coding system that you want to translate to.\nIn this next step of our analysis, we are going to join the World Bank and V-Dem data that we wrangled into a single dataset. To do that we need a common country code. The way we are going to do this is to create a new country code variable in the democracy dataset that matches the one in the women’s empowerment dataset.\nLet’s create a new version of our democracy dataset where we add a variable called iso3c. We will call mutate() to create the variable and wrap the countrycode() call inside of that. The sourcevar that we want to transform is the vdem_ctry_id, the origin code is “vdem”, and the destination code is “wb”.\nWe are also going to pipe in a relocate() call which simply moves the new iso3c column from the end of the data frame (where R automically drops it) so that it sits right next to vdem_ctry_cd. This is not essential but it is always good to keep our data frames looking nice and neat!.\n\n# Load countrycode\nlibrary(countrycode)\n\n# Create new iso3c variable\ndemocracy &lt;- democracy |&gt;    \n  mutate(iso3c = countrycode(sourcevar = vdem_ctry_id, # what we are converting\n        origin = \"vdem\",         # we are converting from vdem\n        destination = \"wb\"))  |&gt; # and converting to the WB iso3c code \n  relocate(iso3c, .after = vdem_ctry_id) # move iso3c \n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 5,667\nColumns: 7\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ iso3c        &lt;chr&gt; \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"MEX\", \"…\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.416, 0.439, 0.456, 0.473, 0.485, 0.513, 0.548, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…"

First, we group the data by certain value or category. Then we summarize it by applying a function like min(), max(), mean(), median() or sd(). Finally, we order the data according to column values.\nLet’s go ahead and apply our three new verbs to the dem_women data frame and store the resulting new data frame in an object called dem_summary.

Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading in the dem_summary.csv file that we made in the last lesson. Next we will do our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary <- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = \"Democracy by region, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nThis looks pretty good but frequently we would want the bars of our bar chart to be sorted in order of the values being displayed. Let’s go ahead and add the reorder() function to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nFirst, let’s grab the relevant data using vdemdata and dplyr. We are going to be downloading the polyarchy measure for the U.S., Japan and Portugal as far back as the data are available. So first we will select country name, year and the polyarchy schore and then we will filter the data based on the three country names. We are saving these data in an object called dem_waves_ctrs.\n\nlibrary(vdemdata)\n\ndem_waves_ctrs <- vdem |>\n  select(\n    country = country_name,     \n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n  ) |>\n  filter( \n    country %in% c(\"United States of America\", # select countries in this list\n                   \"Japan\", \n                   \"Portugal\")\n    )\n\nwrite_csv(dem_waves_ctrs, \"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. The data will be the dem_waves_ctrs object that we just created. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to ` so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Color” with a capital “C.”\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )"

    "text": "Scatter plots\n\nThe last thing we are going to do in this lesson is to create a scatter plot. We use scatter plots in order to illustrate how two variables relate to each other (or not). In this example, we are going to illustrating modernization theory, which predicts a positive relationship between wealth and democracy, while also incorporating levels of women’s representation into our analysis.\nWe are going to start with the dem_women.csv file we created in Module 1.2. We will then group the data by country and calculate the mean for each variable. Note that in the group_by() call we also include region because we will want to keep it so that we can color our points by region.\n\ndem_summary_ctry <- read_csv(\"data/dem_women.csv\") |>\n  group_by(country, region) |> # group by country, keep region\n  summarize(\n    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),\n    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), \n    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), \n    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow let’s create our first scatter plot. Our ggplot() call looks similar to previous ones except for a few things. First we are calling geom_point() for our geom. But also notice that our aesthetics mapping includes four dimenstions: x, y, color and size. So here we are telling ggplot2 that we want wealth on the x-axis, the polyarchy score on the y-axis, to color the points based on region, and to vary the size of the points in relation to the level of women’s representation.\nOne last thing we want to do is to put our x-axis on a log scale and change the labels to reflect their dollar values. For the log scale, we can use the scale_x_log10() function and for the labels we can use the label_number() function from the scales package. We set the prefix to “$” and the suffix to “k” so that each number on the x-axis starts with a dollar sign and ends with “k” denoting “thousands.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will encounter other useful scales functions including label_dollar() and label_percent() in future lessons.\nNotice that in this example we introduce the scales package by including it as a prefix to the label_number() function, e.g. scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\"). This allows us to use the package without having to load it, e.g. library(scales). It also has the benefit of generating a list of auto-complete suggestions for the many available functions in the scales package.\n\n\n\n# in this ggplot() call we have four dimensions\n# x, y, color, and size\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy, color = region, size = women_rep)) + \n  geom_point() + # use geom_point() for scatter plots\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\",\n    size = \"Women Reps\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nThe plot does a good job of illustrating the basic point of modernization theory in that we do see the positive correlation between wealth and democracy. But we also see that there are some outliers and that a lot of the outlier countries are concentrated in the Middle East.\nWe also see that the distribution of women’s representation is somewhat orthogonal to wealth and democracy. Most wealthy western countries have high levels of women’s representation, but so do a lot of low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nAdding a trend line\nWe can definitely see a relationship between wealth and democracy in the scatter plot, but how strong is it? One way to find out is to add a trend line. Let’s do this by adding another geom, geom_smooth(), and specifying a linear model with the argument method = \"lm\" We acn also set the linewidth of the trend line to 1 so that the line is more visible.\nIf we want to add a single trend while also maintaining the coloring by region, then we have to reconfigure the ggplot() call a bit. Specifically, we will want to move color = region to a separate aes() call in the geom_point() function, e.g. geom_point(aes(color = region)). If we don’t do this we will get separate trend lines for each region (try it and see!).\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Region\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\n\n\nLabeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |> \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )"

    "section": "Color schemes",
    "text": "Color schemes\n\nThere are a number of different types of color blindness, but the most common type is red-green color blindness. Making your visualizations colorblind-accessible can be important for convincing certain audiences. Most notably, approximately 8% of men are affected by color blindness.\nLet’s start off by looking at the line chart that we did in the last module pertaining to Huntington’s three waves of democratization:\n\ndem_waves_ctrs <- read_csv(\"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\ndem_waves_chart <- ggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\"\n  )\n\ndem_waves_chart\n\n\n\n\nThe problem with this plot is that people with red-green color blindness will not be able to distinguish between the lines for Japan and Portungal. There are many tools that we could use to see how this is true, but here we are going to focus on the color vision deficiency (CVD) simulator from the colorBlindness package. To use it, all we have to do is load colorBlindness and call cvdPlot() on the stored plot.\n\nlibrary(colorBlindness)\n\ncvdPlot(dem_waves_chart)\n\n\n\n\nIn this output, we can see how deuteranopia and protonopia (red-green color blindness) would experience our plot. Notice how hard it is to distinguish between Japan and Portugal here. We can also see how someone with monochromatic vision would see the plot by looking at the “desaturated (BW)” plot. While monochromatic vision is very rare, we can use this plot to make adjustments for a worst-case scenario.\nSo once you determine that your color scheme is not colorblind friendly, what should you do? There are two basic solutions available to you: making your own colorblind friendly color scheme or use a package that produces colorblind-friendly schemes for you.\n\nCreate your own colorblind-friendly color scheme\nThe first way to make your plot more accessible is to create your own discrete scale using scale_fill_manual() or scale_color_manual() (depending on what type of plot you are trying to draw).\nLet’s try using an example color scheme from the R Cookbook to fill in the bars of a column chart. Here we will make use of the regional levels of female labor force participation data that we prepped in the prework section of this module. First we create a vector of colors called cb_palette. Then we build our bar chart and save it as an object called flfp_region. Crucially, when we perform our ggplot call, we include fill = region as a third dimension in our aes() function. This is in addition to including the region code iso3c on the x-axis. Finally, we use our palette to shade our bars using scale_fill_manual().\n\ncb_palette <- c(\"#E69F00\", \"#56B4E9\", \"#009E73\", \"#F0E442\", \"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\", \"#CC79A7\")\n\nflfp_region <- ggplot(flfp_gdp_regions, aes(x = reorder(iso3c, -flfp), y = flfp, fill = region)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Female Labor Force Participation\", \n    title = \"Levels of female labor force participation by region\", \n    fill = \"Region\",\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank\"\n    ) \n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_manual(values = cb_palette)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can check our visualization using the cvdPlot() function from the colorBlindness package.\n\nflfp_region <- flfp_region + scale_fill_manual(values = cb_palette)\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it would still be difficult for a person with red-green color blindness to see some of the colors in the chart (like the pink of SSF or the bright green of LAC), it would still be possible for them to distinguish the colors of the bars based on what would appear to them as shades of grey.\n\n\nUse viridis\nAnother option is to use a package designed with accessibility issues in mind. One of the more popular ones is the viridis() package. To use it just load viridis and add a viridis color scheme to the plot. You have the option of choosing continuous, discrete or binned color schemes but here we use the discrete option scale_fill_viridis_d() because our regions constitute a discrete variable. You can also try different viridis color maps by inserting the various available schemes in the function. For example you can get the “plasma” map with `scale_fill_viridis_d(option = “plasma”). The default map is “viridis.”\n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s run our bar chart with the viridis color mapping through cvdPlot:\n\nflfp_region <- flfp_region + scale_fill_viridis_d()\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty good. In fact it looks fairly close to the original. It is even to easy to see the differences in colors when looking at the desaturated output. Of course the first column for the black and white plot is difficult to distinguish from the plot’s background, but we will learn how to change this up later in this module.\n\n\nUse ColorBrewer\nAnother package available to us is the RColorBrewer package. Technically, RColorBrewer is a separate package but its color mappings come available as part of ggplot2, so we don’t have to load RColorBrewer in order to use it with ggplot2. We can also use the color brewer palette selector tool to help select palettes that are “colorblind safe.”\nLet’s try updating our column chart with a ColorBrewer color scheme:\n\nflfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\") \n\n\n\n\nAnd now lets run it through the cvdPlot() function.\n\nflfp_region <- flfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\")\n\ncvdPlot(flfp_region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScaling for scatter plots and line charts\nOne thing to note is that when we want to adjust the color scheme for a scatter plot or line chart, we should use “scale_color” instead of “scale_fill”, e.g. scale_color_manual(), scale_color_viridis_d(), scale_color_brewer. Let’s try a couple of examples. First, let’s add a viridis color map to a scatter plot. We will use the flfp_gdp data we prepped in the prework section to generate our scatter plot.\n\nwealth_flfp <- ggplot(flfp_gdp, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = flfp)) + \n  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + # color points by region\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", linewidth = 1) +  # make the line a loess curve\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_dollar()) + # stretch axis, add '$' format\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) + # add % label\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", # x-axis title\n    y = \"Female Labor Force Participation\", # y-axis title\n    title = \"Wealth and female labor force participation\", # plot title\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\", # caption\n    color = \"Region\" # legend title\n    )\n\nwealth_flfp + scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\")\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s try adding a ColorBrewer scheme to a line chart. Here we will use the flfp_ts data frame that we prepped in our prework routine.\n\nflfp_line <- ggplot(flfp_ts, aes(x = year, y = flfp, color = region)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Female Labor Force Participation\", \n    title = \"Regional trends in female labor force participation\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\"\n  )\n\nflfp_line + scale_color_brewer(palette = \"YlOrRd\")"

    "title": "Module 2.2",
    "section": "Annotations",
    "text": "Annotations\n\nSometimes it makes sense to include annotations in our charts. We can achieve this by applying the annotate() function. To add a text annotation, we include “text” for the first argument, then the value of x and y at which we want our annotation to appear, and finally the text of the annotation that we want to display. Let’s try adding text to our indicating where high-, middle- and low-income countries are concentraed on the wealth_flfp scatter plot that we developed earlier.\n\nwealth_flfp <- wealth_flfp + scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") + theme_minimal()\n\nwealth_flfp + annotate(\"text\", x = 90000, y = 75, label = \"Wealthy\") + \n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1000, y = 80, label = \"Low income\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 10000, y = 20, label = \"Middle income\")\n\n\n\n\nAnother common annotation involves combining text with a horizontal or vertical reference line. For a horizontal intercept line we include an additional geom called geom_hline. The first argument is the value yintercept where we want the reference line to cross. Then we can add additional arguments to define the style, color and size of the line.\n\nflfp_line <- flfp_line + scale_color_viridis_d() \n\nflfp_line + geom_hline(yintercept=52, linetype=\"dashed\", color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1995, y = 55, label = \"Global average\")\n\n\n\n\nThe same logic applies for a vertical reference line, except this time the geom is called geom_vline and the first argument, xintercept, is the point at which we want the line to cross the x-axis.\n\nflfp_line <- flfp_line + scale_color_viridis_d() \n\nflfp_line + geom_vline(xintercept=2020, linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2017, y = 35, label = \"Pandemic\")"

    "title": "Module 2.2",
    "section": "Interactivity",
    "text": "Interactivity\n\nOne final thing we can do, which is really fun, is to add interactivity to our plots with plotly. We can do this by simply calling ggplotly() on our plot object.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nggplotly(flfp_line)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a lot of cases, we may want to control the tool tip of the plot. The tool tip is what appears when the user hovers over information on the chart. In this next example, the chart does not look that great unless we add the tooltip argument. But it is fairly simple to do. We just add the elements that we want to appear in a combine function, e.g. c(). In this case we will include region and female labor force participation in the tool tip.\n\nflfp_region <- flfp_region + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGn\") + theme_minimal()\n\nggplotly(flfp_region, tooltip = c(\"region\", \"flfp\")) # controlling the tooltip output\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother thing we may want to do is to include some additional annotations. We might also notice that some of the things we include in the labs argument in ggplot2 do not get picked up by plotly and that we have to add them back with a layout(annotations = ) call. One additional idiosyncrasy is that any item that we want to include in the plotly chart has to be passed as an argument in the ggplot code. For example, we need to include aes(label = country) to view country in tool tip. But plotly does support the R native pipe operator and that makes it a little easier to layer on multiple annotations.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nwealth_flfp_plotly <- wealth_flfp  + \n  scale_color_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  aes(label = country)  # need so ggplot retains label for plotly\n\nggplotly(wealth_flfp_plotly, tooltip = c(\"country\", \"flfp\", \"gdp_pc\")) |> \n  \n  layout(annotations = list(text = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\",  \n                            font = list(size = 10), showarrow = FALSE,\n                            xref = 'paper', x = 1.1, xanchor = 'right', xshift = 0,\n                            yref = 'paper', y = -.1, yanchor = 'auto', yshift = 0)) |> \n  # add web address\n  layout(annotations = list(text = \"www.dataviz-gwu.rocks\", \n                            font = list(size = 10, color = 'grey'), showarrow = FALSE,\n                            xref = 'paper', x = .5, xanchor = 'center', xshift = 0,\n                            yref = 'paper', y = 1, yanchor = 'top', yshift = 0))\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that plotly has some fairly unique syntax for the layout() function. It helps to read the documentation but also to search around on google and Stack Overflow. Each annotation needs to be inputted in a list format. The first time in the list is the text you want to include in the annotation. From there you can include multiple arguments to specify the font size and location of the annotation."

You will start with some data.

    "section": "Turn your map into a function",
    "text": "Turn your map into a function\n\nSometimes you may want to map more than one variable in a paper or display variables with a map in an app. For these situations, it can help to create your own function that allows you to change various components of the map code without having to type out all of the code every time you want to create a map.\n\nCreate the map function\nThe first thing that you want to do is to write out the script for your function. That should include any packages that you need to run that may not already be loaded.\nFrom there, you can build your function. The code for your function contains three elements: 1) a name; 2) the arguments you will include in your function; and 3) a code block of code that will execute when you call the function.\nIn this example, we are going to call our function create_map(). It is going to include five arguments: var_id, title, legend_title, theme and direction. var_id refers to the World Bank variable id, title and legend_title refer to the title of the plot and the title of the legend respectively. theme will allow the user to adjust the viridis theme. And direction refers to whether the color scale is light to dark or dark to light.\nThe code block will first join the country shapes to the selected World Bank data and then map those data by piping them into a ggplot() call. Everything is pretty similar to our previous use of ggplot() and geom_sf(), but one tricky part here is that we have to use eval(parse(text=var_id)))) to remove the quotes surrounding the variable code entered by the user.\n\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(wbstats)\n\ncreate_map <- function(var_id, title, legend_title, theme, direction){\n\nne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\") |> \n  left_join(\n    wb_data(var_id, mrnev = 1), # change variable id\n    join_by(iso_a3_eh == iso3c)\n  ) |> \n  filter(name != \"Antarctica\") |>  \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_sf(aes(fill = eval(parse(text=var_id)))) + # remove quotes\n  labs(\n    title =  title, # change title\n    fill = legend_title, # change legend title\n    caption = \"Source: World Bank Development Indicators\"\n    ) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c( \n    option = \"magma\", #  chg theme\n    direction = direction # change direction of scale\n    )\n}\n\n\n\nDeploy the function in another document\nTo deploy the function in a Quarto or R Markdown dackument, we need to source it as an external R script. First we will save the previous code as a source document. Let’s name our file web-maps.R and save it in a subdirectory called functions. From there, we can use the source() function so that we can call our create_map() function in subsequent code chunks in our document.\n\nsource(\"functions/wb-maps.R\", local = knitr::knit_global())\n\nNow let’s call our create_map() function that we just made using female labor force particpation.\n\ncreate_map(var_id = \"SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\", \n           title= \"Female Labor Force Participation\", \n           legend_title = \"FLFP %\", \n           theme = \"inferno\", \n           direction = -1)\n\n\n\n\nNow search for an indicator we want to use.

    "text": "Facet wrapping\nNow let’s imagine that we really interested in drilling down into the “heterogeneous effects” of wealth on democracy by region. In other words, we want to see more clearly how wealth is related to democracy in some regions but not others. For this, we can use facet_wrap() to get a separate chart for each region rather than just shading the points by region. Inside of facet_wrap() we identify region as the variable that we want to use to separate the plots, e.g. facet_wrap(~region). Notice how we have to include a tilde (~) here.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region) +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see a relationship between wealth and democracy in all of the countries except for the Middle East and Africa. We could speculate that the lack of a relationship in the Middle East could be evidence of an oil curse dynamic whereas perhaps the lack of a relationship in Africa is due to weak institutions.\nThe relationship between wealth and democracy in the West would be apparent, but it is obscured by the fact that western countries because the high wealth and polyarchy values result in extreme bunching in the northwest quadrant of the graph. To deal with this issue, we could add the scales = \"free\" argument to our plot.\n\nggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) + \n  facet_wrap(~ region, scales = \"free\") +\n  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"GDP per Capita\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n    title = \"Wealth and democracy, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nBut notice there is a bit of a tradeoff here. With the scales = free option set, we now have separate axes for each of the plots. This is less of a clean look than having common x and y axes.\n\nLabeling points\nNow let’s try drilling down into one of the regions to get a better sense of what countries are driving the relationship. To do this, we can filter our data set for a region that we are interested in and then add country labels to the points in the scatter plot. Here we are going to filter for “Asia” and we will ad a geom_text() call to add country labels. In the geom_text() call we include arguments for size and vjust to adjust the size and vertical location of the labels relative to the points.\n\ndem_summary_ctry |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Asia\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = gdp_pc, y = polyarchy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_text(aes(label = country), size = 2, vjust = 2) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1) +\n    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = \"$\", suffix = \"k\")) +\n      labs(\n        x= \"GDP Per Capita\", \n        y = \"Polyarchy Score\",\n        title = \"Wealth and democracy in Asia, 1990 - present\", \n        caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n        )"

A choropleth map is a type of data visualization used to show a geographical distribution of data where areas or regions are shaded based on quantities or levels represented in each area or region.\nOne important concept in mapping that we are going to come across this week: simple features. Simple features is a formal international standard for representing objects in the real world in digital space.\nA “feature” is basically any object in the real world that can be represented in two or three-dimensional space. A tree or a house can be a feature as can a forest or a body of water. But in politics e we are usually focused on mapping the political boundaries of different administrative units like countries, states or provinces, counties and cities.\nSimple features allow us to work with such boundaries easily in a dataframe in R. We can take all of the points associated with a geometry and store it in a special data frame column (usually labeled ‘geom’ or ‘geometry’). This ability to store all of the geographic information in one column differs from how spatial data are organized under the traditional spatial objects) standard and makes it much easier to work with geographic data in R."

Pop-ups on maps are essentially windows that allow you to show information related to a particular point or feature on a map without having to navigate away from the current view. Pop-ups can be used to display information such as an address or the name of a city or town. You can customize how pop-ups look, choose what data to display in them and, as you get more advanced, you can even link them to external websites."

There is a whole art to managing international standards organization (ISO) codes which we have already touched on in our discussion of the countrycodes package. For the pruposes of this course, it is enough to be aware of the fact that country-level data sets use different coding systems and that this poses a small hurdle to the visualization and analysis of country-level data.\nFor this analysis, we are going to want to filter by country and specifically we want conflict data for Yemen. According to the UCDP codebook, this dataset uses Gleditsch-Ward (GW) country identifiers. One option could be to simply look up the GW country code for Yemen. But there is also a nice package developed called states. It has a function called sfind() that we can use to find the relevant country code.\n\nlibrary(states)\n\nsfind(\"Yemen\")[1:6]\n\n    list ccode code3c                   country_name      start        end\n169   GW   678    YEM Yemen (Arab Republic of Yemen) 1918-10-30 9999-12-31\n170   GW   680    YPR    Yemen, People's Republic of 1967-11-30 1990-05-21\n428  COW   678    YAR            Yemen Arab Republic 1926-09-02 1990-05-21\n429  COW   679    YEM                          Yemen 1990-05-22 9999-12-31\n430  COW   680    YPR        Yemen People's Republic 1967-11-30 1990-05-21\n\n\nHere we see that the GW code for Yemen is 678. Although there are many listings for Yemen, we know that it is the right code because the Arab Republic of Yemen (our other option for a GW Yemen code) ceased to exist in 1990 following its unification with the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen.\nLet’s go ahead and use our newly discovered country code to wrangle some data for Yemen. We will filter for Yemen’s country ID and events from 2021 and, to keep things manageable, we will only include events that started before March 1 2021.\nLooking again at the codebook, we see there are codings for how certain the coders were regarding where an event occurred and that they also coded for the quality of the reporting. We will keep events with a location precision score less than 3 and an event clarity score equal to 1.\nFrom there we will create a new variable deaths that sums the different categories of deaths (side a, side b, civilian and unknown). Then we will select all of these variables and the location coordinates and use the st_as_sf() function from the sf package to conver the coordinates into simple features objects.\n\nged_yemen <- ged_data |> \n  filter(\n    country_id == 678, #gw country code\n    year == 2021,\n    date_start < \"2021-03-01\", \n    where_prec < 3, # keep if certain where event occurred\n    event_clarity == 1, # keep if event reporting is clear\n      ) |> \n  mutate(deaths = deaths_a + deaths_b + deaths_civilians + deaths_unknown) |>\n  select(event_id = id,\n         country_id,\n         date = date_start,\n         gov_deaths = deaths_a, \n         rebel_deaths = deaths_b, \n         civilian_deaths = deaths_civilians, \n         deaths, \n         where_coordinates,\n         latitude, \n         longitude) |>\n  sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\")) \n\nglimpse(ged_yemen)\n\nRows: 83\nColumns: 9\n$ event_id          <dbl> 378022, 378424, 378425, 378904, 378908, 378942, 3866…\n$ country_id        <dbl> 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 678, 67…\n$ date              <dttm> 2021-01-06, 2021-01-14, 2021-01-20, 2021-01-22, 202…\n$ gov_deaths        <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2…\n$ rebel_deaths      <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ civilian_deaths   <dbl> 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0…\n$ deaths            <dbl> 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2…\n$ where_coordinates <chr> \"Al Ḩaymah as Suflá area\", \"Wādī al Ḩājib village\", …\n$ geometry          <POINT> POINT (44.06 13.70564), POINT (44.04394 13.74153),…"

    "text": "Make a leaflet plot\n\nNow that we have our data, let’s make our first pop-up map. To do this we are going to be using the leaflet package. Leaflet is a really popular JavaScript library for interactive mpas. To get started with leaflet, we’ll make a really simple map with one marker that says “First conflict event.”\n\nPlot a single marker\nLet’s start with a really simple hypothetical example. Let’s say we want to plot one conflict event that we have the coordinates for and label it “First conflict event.” To do this, we would first call the leaflet()function. From there will add default street map tiles with addTiles() and then our single pop-up marker with addMarkers().\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nleaflet() |>\n  addTiles() |>  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng = 45.46916, lat = 14.14912, label = \"First conflict event\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot some conflict events from Yemen\nNow that you have the hang of it, we can move on to plotting some conflict events from our data frame. Again we will call leaflet() but this time we will add data = ged_yemen as an argument. We will also use setView() to center the map on Yemen’s capital Sana’a. We include two arguments for addMarkers. popup = ~as.character(deaths) displays the number of deaths when the user clicks on the marker and label = ~where_coordinates displays the name of the town that the coordinates correspond to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that arguments for the popup = argument take the form of a one-sided formula, meaning that they require a tilde (~) as a prefix. Scroll to the bottom of this page for a more detailed explanation of the ~ notation in this context.\n\n\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |> # map points in ged_yemen data frame\n  addTiles() |> # add default tile\n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |> # Sana'a coordinates\n  addMarkers(\n    popup = ~as.character(deaths), # when user clicks, show deaths\n    label = ~where_coordinates # when user hovers, show town\n    )"

    "text": "Customize your leaflet plot\n\nNext, let’s do some customization to make our map look amazing. We will talk about changing the icon style, customized the information displayed in the icon and adding base maps.\n\nUse an awesome icon\nWe can dress our leaflet map up a little bit with the addAwesomeMarkers() function which allows us to use the glyphicons, font awesome and ionicons libraries.\nFirst we will use awesomeIcons() to store the icon we want to use. Here we choose “ios-close” from the ionic library. We will say that we want the icon colorto be black and the surrounding marker color to be red. Then we call addAwesomeMarkers() and specify icon = icon to call the red and black ionic marker.\n\nicon <- awesomeIcons(\n  icon = \"ios-close\",\n  iconColor = \"black\",\n  markerColor = \"red\", \n  library = \"ion\" \n)\n\n# Get data for Jan and Feb\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |>   \n  addTiles() |> \n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |> # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~as.character(deaths), \n    label = ~where_coordinates\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange content of the popup\nLet’s say we want to add more information to our pop-up when the user clicks on it. Instead of just showing the total number of deaths, we also want to show the date of the event and the breakdown of government deaths, rebel deaths and civilian deaths.\nThe easiest way to do this is going to be to add a column to our data frame with a label associated with each event. We will use the base R sprintf() function combined with htmltools to create these labels. sprintf() returns a formatted string using values in a list. The first parameter in sprintf is the format and the second is the values that go into the format.\nIn this example, we are separating the lines of our label with html () and we are passing in a string (%s) for the date and numeric values (%.0f) for the number of deaths.\nThen we call HMTL from htmltools and use lapply() to apply the function to every line in the data frame.\n\nged_yemen$popup_text <- sprintf(\n      \"Date: %s <br> \n       Total Deaths: %.0f <br> \n       Govt. Deaths: %.0f <br> \n       Rebel Deaths: %.0f <br> \n       Civilian Death: %.0f <br>\",\n      ged_yemen$date, \n      ged_yemen$deaths, \n      ged_yemen$gov_deaths, \n      ged_yemen$rebel_deaths,\n      ged_yemen$civilian_deaths\n    ) |> lapply(htmltools::HTML)\n\nNow we can use the new labels to enhance the markers by specifying popup = ~popup_text in the addAwesomeMarkers() function.\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |>  \n  addTiles() |> \n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |> # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~popup_text, \n    label = ~where_coordinates\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s spot check the labels.\n\nged_yemen |>\n  filter(where_coordinates == \"Marib Dam\")\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 9 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 45.24417 ymin: 15.39639 xmax: 45.24417 ymax: 15.39639\nCRS:           NA\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  event_id country_id date                gov_deaths rebel_deaths\n*    <dbl>      <dbl> <dttm>                   <dbl>        <dbl>\n1   385602        678 2021-02-26 00:00:00         34           27\n# ℹ 5 more variables: civilian_deaths <dbl>, deaths <dbl>,\n#   where_coordinates <chr>, geometry <POINT>, popup_text <list>\n\n\n\n\nUsing basemaps\nAs a last step, let’s change the basemap. We can do this by specifying addProviderTiles() instead of addTiles() and specifying the basemap that we want to use. Here is a list of available basemaps. For this example, we are going to use “OpenTopoMap.”\n\nleaflet(data = ged_yemen) |> # Jan and Feb  \n  addProviderTiles(\"OpenTopoMap\") |> # include name of provider here\n  setView(lng = 44.1910, lat = 15.3694, zoom = 6) |> # Sana'a coordinates\n  addAwesomeMarkers(\n    icon = icon, \n    popup = ~popup_text, \n    label = ~where_coordinates\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see a bit more about the topography, which could be super-useful for conflict analysis."
