If you have substantial non-academic obligations or other concerns (e.g., food insecurity, work, childcare, athletic commitments, language barriers, financial issues, technology access, commuting, etc.) that make learning difficult, please contact me. I’ll keep this information confidential, and together, we can brainstorm ways to meet your needs.\n\n\nOther Needs\nAny student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, and believes this may affect their performance in the course, is urged to contact GW’s Office of Student Financial Assistance for support. Furthermore, please notify me if you are comfortable doing so. Some other resources to support you are found under the course menu item Student Resources and include support for academic achievement and personal well-being. (Adapted from Goldrick-Rab, 2017)"

    "text": "Emergency Preparedness and Response Procedures\nThe University has asked all faculty to inform students of these procedures, prepared by the GW Office of Public Safety and Emergency Management in collaboration with the Office of the Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs.\n\nTo Report an Emergency or Suspicious Activity\nCall the University Police Department at 202-994-6111 (Foggy Bottom) or 202-242-6111 (Mount Vernon).\n\n\nShelter in Place – General Guidance\nAlthough it is unlikely that we will ever need to shelter in place, it is helpful to know what to do just in case. No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter in place will generally remain the same.\n\nIf you are inside, stay where you are unless the building you are in is affected. If it is affected, you should evacuate. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the scene.\nLocate an interior room to shelter inside. If possible, it should be above ground level and have the fewest number of windows. If sheltering in a room with windows, move away from the windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms may be necessary.\nShut and lock all windows (for a tighter seal) and close exterior doors.\nTurn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off ventilation systems as quickly as possible).\nMake a list of the people with you and ask someone to call the list in to UPD so they know where you are sheltering and who is with you. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list.\nAwait further instructions. If possible, visit GW Campus Advisories for incident updates or call the GW Information Line 202-994-5050.\nMake yourself comfortable and look after one other. You will get word as soon as it is safe to come out.\n\n\n\nEvacuation\nAn evacuation will be considered if the building we are in is affected or we must move to a location of greater safety. We will always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds. In the event of an evacuation, please gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, GWorld card, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit. Every classroom has a map at the door designating both the shortest egress and an alternate egress. Anyone who is physically unable to walk down the stairs should wait in the stairwell, behind the closed doors. Firemen will check the stairwells upon entering the building. Once you have evacuated the building, proceed to our primary rendezvous location: the court yard area between the GW Hospital and Ross Hall. In the event that this location is unavailable, we will meet on the ground level of the Visitors Parking Garage (I Street entrance, at 22nd Street). From our rendezvous location, we will await instructions to re-enter the School.\n\n\nAlert DC\nAlert DC provides free notification by e-mail or text message during an emergency. Visit GW Campus Advisories for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to GW. If you receive an Alert DC notification during class, you are encouraged to share the information immediately.\n\n\nGW Alert\nGW Alert provides popup notification to desktop and laptop computers during an emergency. In the event that we receive an alert to the computer in our classroom, we will follow the instructions given. You are also encouraged to download this application to your personal computer. Visit GW Campus Advisories to learn how.\n\n\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information about emergency preparedness and response at GW or the University’s operating status can be found on GW Campus Advisories or by calling the GW Information Line at 202-994-5050."

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) develop by a company named Posit. Please be sure to download and install the most recent versions of R and R Studio from Posit’s website.\nIt is a good idea to periodically update R and RStudio. RStudio will prompt you when it is time to update and you can follow the same process of downloading and installing from the Posit website that we just did here. For R, there are a number of ways to do it, but the easiest is to use packages like installr for Windows and updateR for Mac. Here is a good blog post that walks you through the steps of how to update R using these packages. I usually update R once a semester.\nWe are going to be using a number of R packages throughout the course. One essential set of packages are those that comprise the Tidyverse, but especially readr, dplyr, ggplot2 and tidyr. You can install the entire Tidyverse collection of packages by typing install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in your console. We will talk about these packages in detail as we go through the course, but have a look at this basic description now to gain some basic familiarity.\nAnother thing that you really want to do is to make sure that you have the native pipe operator (|&gt;) enabled. In RStudio, go to Tools&gt;Global Options, then go to Code and select “Use native pipe operator.”\nWhile you are here, you can also go to Appearance to select a different editor theme or to Pane Layout to change how the four panes in R Studio are organized. Next, familiarize yourself with how to expand and minimize the four windows. The most important window that I want to highlight here is the source window. This is where we are going to be working most of the time in this course. And if I tell you to send your source code, I mean to send the file that you are working on in this window. This could be a Quarto document, an R script or an app.R file for a Shiny app.\nThe next window is the Console and there we also see tabs for Terminal and Background Jobs. The console is where you can run R code one line at a time. The terminal is relevant for more advanced users and we will make some use of it when we talk about publishing Quarto documents. Background Jobs is going to be helpful when we want troubleshoot a Quarto document that is not rendering properly.\nFrom there, the next pane we want to explore is Environment, History, etc. Environment tells us what files are currently available to us. The other important tab here is Git which will be where we push things to GitHub. You will be using this a lot in the course.\nFinally, we see a pane with Files, Plots, Packages etc. Files tells us what files are in our project folder and enables us to copy, and delete files associated with our project. Plots is a window for viewing our visualizations. And Packages shows us what packages are available and loaded into our environment.\nBefore you move on to the next section, take some time to familiarize yourself with the various user-friendly buttons and shortcuts available to you like the drop down menu for the pane layout, a spell checker, a button for inserting a code chunk and other features that you can play around with."

If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto."

You can use Markdown in multiple different contexts and IDEs, but the syntax is always going to be the same.\n\nHere are some key points about writing in Markdown you should know:\nFor basic text, you can simply start typing. To insert a line break, use two spaces followed by the return (enter) key. Headings are created using hashmarks: # for the largest heading (level 1), ## for the next largest (level 2), and ### for the subsequent size (level 3).\nEmphasis in Markdown is achieved using asterisks: for italics, enclose the word with a single asterisk (*), and for bold, use double asterisks (**). Lists can be either bullet points, created using a dash (-), or numbered lists, initiated with 1., 2., etc.\nTo insert links, the syntax is [text](url), and for images, you use ![](file path or url). Code chunks allow you to include blocks of code directly in your text. R code chunks are wrapped with {r}..., and Python code chunks with {python}.... This syntax allows for easy inclusion of various types of content directly in your Markdown document, facilitating a rich text formatting experience across different platforms and IDEs."

Then read on for a more detailed explanation.\n\nObjects are the basic building blocks in R. You can store anything as an object. For example, you can store a number, a character or a data frame, a list, or a function as an object. You can even store the output of a function, like a data visualization, as an object.\nTo store an object as a function you use the assignment operator &lt;-. For example, to store the number 5 as an object called x, you would write x &lt;- 5. If you were to store another number as an object, you would use the same assignment operator. For example, y &lt;- 10. Then you could take these two objects and do something with them, like add them together. To add x and y together, you would write x + y.\nWhat is a function? A function is a set of instructions that you give to R. You can think of a function as a recipe. For example, if you wanted to make a cake, you would follow a recipe. The recipe would tell you what ingredients to use and what steps to take to make the cake. In R, you can use a function to do something, like add two numbers together, or create a data visualization.\nTo use a function, you write the name of the function, followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you put the input that you want to give to the function. For example, if you wanted to add two numbers together, you would use the sum function. You would write sum(5, 10)."

The “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics.” The grammar of graphics is a layered approach to constructing graphs based on a book by Leland Wilkinson.\nThe idea is that each visualization you make is going to contain cerain elements. You will start with some data. Then you will incorporate some “aesthetics” which you can think of as the dimensions of the visualization (x-axis, y-axis and color, size or shapes for additional dimensions). Next you identify a geometric obejct that you want to use such as a bar, a line or a point. From there you can customize various elements of the plot like the title and axis scales and labels."

Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading the data dem_summary.csv file that you downloaded in the prework section. Next we will do our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = \"Democracy by region, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\nThis looks pretty good but frequently we would want the bars of our bar chart to be sorted in order of the values being displayed. Let’s go ahead and add the reorder() function to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nNext, let’s import the dem_waves_ctrs CSV file from our project folder and save it in an object of the same name.\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis importing the data from a CSV file represents a slightly different workflow than was used in the line chart video where I downloaded and wrangled the data from the V-Dem API. We will come back to wrangling data later on in the course.\n\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to `1’ so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Country” with a capital “C.”\nLet’s run that, save it as an object and then call the object to view the visualization.\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )"

    "text": "Downloading data from the V-Dem API\n\nThe first thing we want to talk about is how to filter observations and to select variables for analysis. We will also delve into the topic of how to create new variables. To illustrate these concepts, we are going to be working with the V-Dem Dataset. The V-Dem offers an R package for downloading its data called vdemdata.\nvdemdata is perfect for illustrating the filter() and select() verbs because its main function for downloading the data (vdem) does not take any arguments (it simply downloads the whole dataset). So you have to use R functions to narrow down the variables and years you want to work with.\nWhile V-Dem has wealth of indicators related to democracy, we are going to focus on the most famous one called the “polyarchy” score. We are also going to download data on per capita GDP and create some indicator variables for region that we will use later on when we summarize the data. Along with those variables, we also want to retain country_name, year and country_id for the purposes of merging these data with our World Bank data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile V-Dem has a variable look-up tool (find_var), it does not provide very much information on the variables that the search function returns. Therefore, if you want to use this package for your own research, I highly recommend just going to the V-Dem codebook and manually grabbing the codes for the indicators that you want to use in your analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to filtering out years and selecting variables, let’s also create a region coding to facilitate our analysis later on. We will do this by piping in a mutate() call where we use the case_match() function to change the region from a numeric variable to a string. This will come in handy when we go to visualize the data in future lessons.\nWe will store our new data as an object called democracy.\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(vdemdata) # to download V-Dem data\n\n# Download the data\ndemocracy &lt;- vdem |&gt; # download the V-Dem dataset\n  filter(year &gt;= 1990)  |&gt; # filter out years less than 1990\n  select(                  # select (and rename) these variables\n    country = country_name,     # the name before the = sign is the new name  \n    vdem_ctry_id = country_id,  # the name after the = sign is the old name\n    year, \n    polyarchy = v2x_polyarchy, \n    gdp_pc = e_gdppc, \n    region = e_regionpol_6C\n    ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    region = case_match(region, # replace the values in region with names\n                     1 ~ \"Eastern Europe\", \n                     2 ~ \"Latin America\",  \n                     3 ~ \"Middle East\",   \n                     4 ~ \"Africa\", \n                     5 ~ \"The West\", \n                     6 ~ \"Asia\")\n                    # number on the left of the ~ is the V-Dem region code\n                    # we are changing the number to the country name on the right\n                    # of the equals sign\n  )\n\n# View the data\nglimpse(democracy)\n\nRows: 5,846\nColumns: 6\n$ country      &lt;chr&gt; \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico\", \"Mexico…\n$ vdem_ctry_id &lt;dbl&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, …\n$ year         &lt;dbl&gt; 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 199…\n$ polyarchy    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.396, 0.418, 0.441, 0.451, 0.472, 0.489, 0.511, 0.560, 0…\n$ gdp_pc       &lt;dbl&gt; 11.389, 11.635, 11.883, 11.983, 12.043, 11.742, 12.059, 1…\n$ region       &lt;chr&gt; \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin America\", \"Latin…"

To get Reveal output you should specify revealjs as the output format in your YAML header, e.g.\nformat: revealjs \nQuarto’s reveal.js supports many of the standard features you see in other presentation formats such as incremental lists, multiple columns, speaker notes, and a variety of themes for customization. Users can include code blocks with line highlighting and execute code within slides, adapting content to different screen sizes with options for scrollable content and smaller fonts. Additionally, it allows for the integration of multimedia backgrounds, including images, videos, and iframes, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of presentations.\nTake a moment to check out the Quarto reveal.js guide for an overview of its capabilities and think about which ones you might want to use in your own presentation."

This will create a new directory called public in your project directory.

LaTeX is a powerful tool, but it can be complex and difficult to learn.\nTo get a better understanding of what LaTeX is and why it is useful, watch the video below.\n\nFor a more detailed introduction to LaTeX, check out this website.\nQuarto makes it easy to use LaTeX without having to learn all of the ins and outs of LaTeX. As you continue your Quarto journey, you will probably need to learn a bit of LaTeX to make minor adjustments to the formatting.\nMost people who write seriously in LaTeX use a LaTeX editor. There are many options, but some popular ones include TeXShop, TeXworks, and Overleaf. Overleaf is a cloud-based LaTeX editor that is popular because it is easy to use and it allows for real-time collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe won’t be using a LaTeX editor in this course.

But there are other custom formats that can be used for working papers and other documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExtenxions are available for other formats including HTML and revealjs slides. Personally, I tend to use extensions most when I am trying to style a pdf document, which is why I mention them here.\n\n\nTo use an extension for a new document you are going to type quarto use template quarto-journals/name_of_extension in the terminal while in the directory of your project folder. For existing documents, type quarto add quarto-journals/name_of_extension. To render the document using the extension, you can use the terminal command quarto render name_of_document.qmd --to name_of_extension-pdf or you can specify the extension in the YAML header of your document like this:\nformat:\n  pdf: default\n  name_of_extension-pdf:\n    keep-tex: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to change name_of_extension to the name of the extension that you want to use and name_of_document to the name of your document."

Parameters can be used to control the content of the document, the formatting of the document, and the output format of the document. To define a parameter, you use the params key in the YAML header. Here is an example of a parameter definition:\nparams:\n  country: \"Afghanistan\"\nHere our we have defined country as a parameter. Right now, the country parameter is set to “Afghanistan” but we could change it to any country that might appear in our dataset or that we might want to talk about in our report. You can set your parameters to any value that you want and then call the parameters later on in your report with params$parameter where parameter is the name of the parameter.\nFor example, you could use the country parameter to filter a dataset to only include data for a specific country. You could also use the country to create a title for a plot that includes the country name.. For example, we could produce a line chart of the country we specified in the YAML header:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gapminder)\n\n# Filter the gapminder dataset to only include data for the specified country and year\ngapminder_filtered &lt;- gapminder |&gt;\n  filter(country == params$country)\n\n# Create a plot\nggplot(gapminder_filtered, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(title = paste(\"Life Expectancy in\", params$country)) +\n  theme_minimal()"
