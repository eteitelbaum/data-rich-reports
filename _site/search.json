We will learn how to make bar charts, histograms, line charts and scatter plots.\nAlong the way we are going to be talking about the “grammar of graphics” that ggplot2 is based on. The “gg” in ggplot stands for “grammar of graphics.” The grammar of graphics is a layered approach to constructing graphs based on a book by Leland Wilkinson.\nThe idea is that each visualization you make is going to contain cerain elements. You will start with some data. Then you will incorporate some “aesthetics” which you can think of as the dimensions of the visualization (x-axis, y-axis and color, size or shapes for additional dimensions). Next you identify a geometric obejct that you want to use such as a bar, a line or a point. From there you can customize various elements of the plot like the title and axis scales and labels.",

    "text": "Bar charts\n\nLet’s get started with our first visualization–a basic bar chart. Bar charts are good for comparing data across cases. Our aim here is going to be to summarize levels of democracy across different regions like we did in the last lesson, but this time we will illustrate the differences with a chart.\nWe will start by loading the data dem_summary.csv file that you downloaded in the prework section. Next we will do our first ggplot() call. The ggplot() function takes two arguments: data and mapping. data refers to the data frame that includes the variables we want to visualize and mapping refers to the aesthetics mappings for the visualization. The aesthetics mappings are themselves presented in a quoting function aes() that defines the x and y values of the plot along with other aesthetic values like fill, color and linetype. We will focus on x and y values here and return to these additional aesthetic values later.\nAfter our ggplot() call, we can add a series of additional functions to define our visualization following a + sign. The most important group are the geoms which will define the basic type of plot we want to make. In this case, we are calling geom_col() for our histogram and specifying that the fill color should be “steelblue.”\nFrom there we will further customize our visualization with the labs() function to provide a title, axis labels and a caption.\n\ndem_summary &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_summary.csv\")\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = region, y = polyarchy)) + # ggplot call\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + # we use geom_col() for a a bar chart\n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg. Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = \"Democracy by region, 1990 - present\", \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks pretty good but frequently we would want the bars of our bar chart to be sorted in order of the values being displayed. Let’s go ahead and add the reorder() function to our aes() call so that we are reordering the bars based on descending values of the average polyarchy score.\n\nggplot(dem_summary, aes(x = reorder(region, -polyarchy), y = polyarchy)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Region\", \n    y = \"Avg.

For this visualization, we will try to illustrate Samuel Huntington’s waves of democracy by showing how countries representing each of the three waves. The U.S. represents the first wave, Japan the second wave starting with the allied victory in WWII, and Portugal represents the first country to transition in the third wave.\nNext, let’s import the dem_waves_ctrs CSV file from our project folder and save it in an object of the same name.\n\ndem_waves_ctrs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/dem_waves_ctrs.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis importing the data from a CSV file represents a slightly different workflow than was used in the line chart video where I downloaded and wrangled the data from the V-Dem API. We will come back to wrangling data later on in the course.\n\n\nNext, we are going to do our ggplot() call. For the aesthetics mapping, we will put the year on the x-axis and the polyarchy score on the y-axis. We will also specify color in the aes() call so that we can color the lines by region.\nTo get a line chart, we have to specify geom_line(). Then within the geom_line() function we will set the linewidth equal to `1’ so that the lines are a bit more visible.\nFinally, we will add a labs() call as with the previous visualizations. But in addition to title, axis labels and a caption, we will also add color = \"Country\" to change the label of the legend to “Country” with a capital “C.”\nLet’s run that, save it as an object and then call the object to view the visualization.\n\n# in this ggplot() call, we add a third dimension for line color\nggplot(dem_waves_ctrs, aes(x = year, y = polyarchy, color = country)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1) + # our geom is a line with a width of 1\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year\", \n    y = \"Polyarchy Score\", \n    title = 'Democracy in countries representing three different \"waves\"', \n    caption = \"Source: V-Dem Institute\", \n    color = \"Country\" # make title of legend to upper case\n  )",

    "text": "Quarto\n\nOnce you have R, R Studio and Quarto installed, you are ready to start integrating text and code with Quarto. Quarto is an open source publishing platform that enables you to integrate text with code. If you have used R Markdown before then Quarto will look familiar to you because Quarto is the next generation of R Markdown.\nRStudio comes with a version of Quarto already installed, but it can be useful to install the most recent version separately and because doing so will allow you to use Quarto with another IDE like VS Code. You can install the most recent version of Quarto by visiting this page and selecting the version for your operating system.\nNow take a little time to create a Quarto project in R Studio and make sure everything is working properly. But before you get started, create a new folder(directory) for this course on your computer somewhere. Once that is done, go to File &gt; New Project. Then select Quarto Project and name the project something like “test-project” in the Directory name field. Next, select Browse and navigate to the folder that you created for this course. Select Create Project.\nYou will notice that in your new project folder there is a file with an .Rproj extension. The .Rproj file is what tells RStudio which files are associated with the project and it obviates the need to set the working directory. It also makes it possible to share the folder with anyone who is running R and RStudio and have them run your code without having to set a working directory. This is what we refer to as a project-based workflow and we will use it for every assignment in this class.\nNow try rendering the document with the Render toggle button. By default, Quarto renders an .html file that it will open in a browser and save to your project folder.\nNext we want to try rendering a .pdf document. To do this, we have to install tinytex, a lightweight version of LaTeX. To do this, go to the Terminal and type quarto install tinytex. Now, change the format from html to pdf by inserting format: pdf in the YAML header. Then render the document again. A .pdf document should open up.\nNow take a few minutes and try changing more of the code in the YAML header. You can try changing the title, adding a subtitle (subtitle:) or changing the execution options. By default, Quarto uses the visual editor but behind the scenes it is using Markdown. Try and edit some text using the toggle buttons available in the visual editor and then switch to Source to view the underlying Markdown code. Play with the R code chunks embedded in the document or try adding new code chunks.\nYou may already have some experience writing in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that enables you to format plaintext files. If you have not used Markdown, or if your memory is hazy, don’t worry: it is really easy to learn. Have a look at this Markdown cheat sheet and try to familiarize yourself with its basic syntax. Finally, take some time to get familiar with the Guide and Reference sections of the Quarto website. Then take a look at the gallery so that you can get an idea of the kinds of things you can produce with Quarto.",

Then read on for a more detailed explanation.\n\nObjects are the basic building blocks in R. You can store anything as an object. For example, you can store a number, a character or a data frame, a list, or a function as an object. You can even store the output of a function, like a data visualization, as an object.\nTo store an object as a function you use the assignment operator &lt;-. For example, to store the number 5 as an object called x, you would write x &lt;- 5. If you were to store another number as an object, you would use the same assignment operator. For example, y &lt;- 10. Then you could take these two objects and do something with them, like add them together. To add x and y together, you would write x + y.\nWhat is a function? A function is a set of instructions that you give to R. You can think of a function as a recipe. For example, if you wanted to make a cake, you would follow a recipe. The recipe would tell you what ingredients to use and what steps to take to make the cake. In R, you can use a function to do something, like add two numbers together, or create a data visualization.\nTo use a function, you write the name of the function, followed by parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you put the input that you want to give to the function. For example, if you wanted to add two numbers together, you would use the sum function. You would write sum(5, 10).",

No matter where you are, the basic steps of shelter in place will generally remain the same.\n\nIf you are inside, stay where you are unless the building you are in is affected. If it is affected, you should evacuate. If you are outdoors, proceed into the closest building or follow instructions from emergency personnel on the scene.\nLocate an interior room to shelter inside. If possible, it should be above ground level and have the fewest number of windows. If sheltering in a room with windows, move away from the windows. If there is a large group of people inside a particular building, several rooms may be necessary.\nShut and lock all windows (for a tighter seal) and close exterior doors.\nTurn off air conditioners, heaters, and fans. Close vents to ventilation systems as you are able. (University staff will turn off ventilation systems as quickly as possible).\nMake a list of the people with you and ask someone to call the list in to UPD so they know where you are sheltering and who is with you. If only students are present, one of the students should call in the list.\nAwait further instructions. If possible, visit GW Campus Advisories for incident updates or call the GW Information Line 202-994-5050.\nMake yourself comfortable and look after one other. You will get word as soon as it is safe to come out.\n\n\n\nEvacuation\nAn evacuation will be considered if the building we are in is affected or we must move to a location of greater safety. We will always evacuate if the fire alarm sounds. In the event of an evacuation, please gather your personal belongings quickly (purse, keys, GWorld card, etc.) and proceed to the nearest exit. Every classroom has a map at the door designating both the shortest egress and an alternate egress. Anyone who is physically unable to walk down the stairs should wait in the stairwell, behind the closed doors. Firemen will check the stairwells upon entering the building. Once you have evacuated the building, proceed to our primary rendezvous location: the court yard area between the GW Hospital and Ross Hall. In the event that this location is unavailable, we will meet on the ground level of the Visitors Parking Garage (I Street entrance, at 22nd Street). From our rendezvous location, we will await instructions to re-enter the School.\n\n\nAlert DC\nAlert DC provides free notification by e-mail or text message during an emergency. Visit GW Campus Advisories for a link and instructions on how to sign up for alerts pertaining to GW. If you receive an Alert DC notification during class, you are encouraged to share the information immediately.\n\n\nGW Alert\nGW Alert provides popup notification to desktop and laptop computers during an emergency. In the event that we receive an alert to the computer in our classroom, we will follow the instructions given. You are also encouraged to download this application to your personal computer. Visit GW Campus Advisories to learn how.\n\n\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information about emergency preparedness and response at GW or the University’s operating status can be found on GW Campus Advisories or by calling the GW Information Line at 202-994-5050.",

Writing in Markdown is an easy way to standardize your writing process and to ensure that your documents are easily readable across different platforms. When you write in Markdown, and let Quarto handle the formatting, you never have to worry about fiddling around with dropdowns or any of the stuff you would have to do with a standard processing tool.

You can use Markdown in multiple different contexts and IDEs, but the syntax is always going to be the same.\n\nHere are some key points about writing in Markdown you should know:\nFor basic text, you can simply start typing. To insert a line break, use two spaces followed by the return (enter) key. Headings are created using hashmarks: # for the largest heading (level 1), ## for the next largest (level 2), and ### for the subsequent size (level 3).\nEmphasis in Markdown is achieved using asterisks: for italics, enclose the word with a single asterisk (*), and for bold, use double asterisks (**). Lists can be either bullet points, created using a dash (-), or numbered lists, initiated with 1., 2., etc.\nTo insert links, the syntax is [text](url), and for images, you use ![](file path or url). Code chunks allow you to include blocks of code directly in your text. R code chunks are wrapped with {r}..., and Python code chunks with {python}.... This syntax allows for easy inclusion of various types of content directly in your Markdown document, facilitating a rich text formatting experience across different platforms and IDEs.",
