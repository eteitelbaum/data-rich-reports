It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website."
