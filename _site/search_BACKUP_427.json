    "text": "Here are some datasets that you might consider using for your final project:\n\nILOSTAT is the statistical database of the International Labour Organisation. It has data pertaining to labor, working conditions, industrial relations, poverty and inequality.\nGoogle Public Data Explorer contains information about dozens of databases related to governance and the economy. You cannot download the raw data from Google, but you can use the site to visualize the data and then follow the link to the original source.\nOECD DATA provides data related to the performance of high income countries.\nOur World in Data is a good general resource for political economy data. The site is centered around blog posts but you can also search for a topic, view a visualization related to that topic and then download the data used to create it.\nStatista is a good place to look for data on more niche topics.\nUNCTADstat is the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development statistical database. It provides harmonized data on a range of topics related to economic performance, trade and statistics.\nThe UN Human Development Reports include a number of important indicators related to human development, gender and sustainable development goals (SDGs).\nVarieties of Democracy (V-DEM) provides original measures of the quality of democracy for every country dating back to the 18th century.\nWorld Bank Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary World Bank database for development data from officially-recognized international sources.\nThe World Bank DataBank provides access to dozens of additional World Bank databases on topics such as regional development, governance, education, gender and the environment.\n\nFor information on more specific resources available, see this page on the Gelman Library website."
