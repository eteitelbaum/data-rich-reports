Try summarizing the data with a [different function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html#useful-functions) for one or more of the variables. \n  a. What is the median value of `polyarchy` for The West?\n  b. What is the max value of `gdp_pc` for Eastern Europe?\n  c. What is the standard deviation of `flfp` for Africa?\n  d. What is the interquartile range of `women_rep` for the Middle East?\n  \n2. Now try grouping by country instead of region. \n\n  a. What is the median value of `polyarchy` for Sweden?\n  b. What is the max value of `gdp_pc` New Zealand?\n  c. What is the standard deviation of `flfp` for Spain?\n  d. What is the interquartile range of `women_rep` for Germany?\n\n3. Sort countries in descending order based on the mean value of `gdp_pc` (instead of the median value of `polyarchy`). Which country ranks first based on this sorting?\n\n4. Now try sorting countries in ascending order based on the median value of `women_rep` (hint: delete \"desc\" from the `arrange()` call). Which country ranks at the \"top\" of the list?\n\n## Coding Assignment 1\n\n<br>\n\n[Coding assignment 1](https://dataviz-esia.training/assignments/coding-assignment-1) builds off this lesson\n\n<br>\n\nTake the remainder of the class time to work on it. I will be here in case you have questions. \n\n<br>\n\nYou may work individually or in groups. ",
