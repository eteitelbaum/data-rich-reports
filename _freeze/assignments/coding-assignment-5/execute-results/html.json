For convenience, we will be looking a Journal of Democracy [article](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxygw.wrlc.org/article/225602) by Huntington that summarizes his main points from the book. You will be doing most of your coding in the separate `app.R` template provided for you. A big part of your grade for this assignment will be based on getting that file to produce your Shiny App. However, you can use this document as a worksheet to help generate the various elements of code for your App. \n\n**Submission note**: For this assignment you should submit your working Shiny App code via GitHub. You can use this workbook to develop your code.\n\n## Step 1: Wrangle your data (20 pts)\n\nLoad `vdemdata`, `dplyr` and `readr` into a separate R script or code chunk in a Quarto document. Select `country_name`, `year`, and three V-Dem democracy indicators: `v2x_polyarchy`, `v2x_libdem`, and `v2x_paritpdem`. Now go to the [V-Dem codebook](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/24/codebook_v13.pdf) and select four additional indicators related to democracy that you would like to explore. Make sure that your chosen indicators cover the same time period as those in the app (1789-2021). Have a `glimpse()` and the data to make sure everythign is there. Then store your data in an object called `vdem_trends` and then save it as a .csv file by the same name. \n\n## Step 2: Do the setup work (20 pts)\n\nNow, in your `app.R` file, load your packages, load the data into an object called `vdem_trends`, and create lists of the variables and countries for the `ui`. \n\n**Packages**: You will need to load `shiny`, `shinyWidgets`, `readr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and `lubridate`. \n\n**Data**: These will be loaded in from the .csv file you created in Step 1. \n\n**Variable list**: Create a list of values using the combine function (`c()`) to be used in the \"Indicator\" dropdown menu. Some starter code is provided for you here:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvars <- c(\"Polyarchy\" = \"v2x_polyarchy\"), # be sure to insert the variable names you have \n          \"Liberal Democracy\" = ......   # in your wrangled data on the right hand side\n          )                              # of these equations \n```\n:::\n\n\n**Country names list**: To get a list of country names, `filter()` `vdem_trends` for one year (tip: you can use `max(year)` for this), [pull()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pull.html) the country column and pipe that into `sort()` (with no arguments) so that the country names are arranged in alphabetical order. Store the list of country names in an object called `countries`. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountries <- vdem_trends |>\n  filter(....) |> # filter what?\n  pull(....) |>   # pull what?\n  sort()          # no arguments for sort\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step 3: Define the UI (20 pts)\n\nDefine the UI using code similar to what we saw for the FRED line chart app in Module 5.2. You will want a quarter of the columns to be occupied by the `wellPanel()` with the \"Indicator:\" and \"Country:\" dropdown menus and some help text. The remaining 3/4 of the space is going to be occupied by your plot output. For the slider input, use this code: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n           sliderTextInput(\n             \"range\",\n             NULL,\n             grid = TRUE,\n             choices = 1789:2021,\n             selected = c(1789, 2021),\n             width = \"100%\"\n           )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step 4: Define the server logic (20 pts)\n\nNow the tricky part. This app is going to require two reactive functions. The first is going to be for the country and indicator dropdowns:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  ctry_indicator <- reactive({\n    vdem_trends |>\n    filter(country == INPUT) |> # replace INPUT with relevant input\n    select(year, INPUT)         # ditto\n    })\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe second is going to be for the year slider: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  plot_df <- reactive({\n    ctry_indicator() |>\n    filter(year %in% (INPUT:INPUT)) # replace INPUT with relevant input\n   })\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow you need to render the plot. In the `ggplot()` call your data is going to be the saved in the second reactive function `plot_df()` (don't forget the parentheses!). In `aes()` `x` will simply be `year` but y is a little tricky. Here you need to call `get(input$indicator))` You might have guessed the `input$indicator` part, but to [non-standard evaluation](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Computing-on-the-language.html) in `aes()`, you cannot pass your column into ggplot before you remove the parentheses. `get()` is one of [many ways](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19826352/pass-character-strings-to-ggplot2-within-a-function) to do this.   \n\nFor the y-labels, you can use `names(vars[which(vars == input$indicator)]))` to get the name of the selected indicator. \n\n## Step 5: Run the app and interpret the results (20 pts)\n\nUse the `shinyApp()` funciton to run the app. Does it work? If not, try some of the debugging techniques we talked about in class or reach out on Discord for help. \n\nOnce you get the app running, take some time to explore the data in a few of your favorite countries. How do the trends in your chosen cases speak to Huntington's idea about a third wave of democratization or, anecdotally, the types barriers that remain to democratization in that country? Type your answer below (not in your `app.R` file!). \n\n",
