## Prework

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Overview

Discuss some basic principles of design like no more than four lines, arranging bar charts in descending order, etc. Link to a relevant guide. 

## Themes

```{r}
dem_summary_ctry <- read_csv("data/dem_summary_ctry.csv")

ggplot(dem_summary_ctry, aes(x = gdp_pc, y = flfp)) + # plot gdp_pc on the x-axys and flfp on the y-axis 
  geom_point(aes(color = region)) + # add an aesthetic to color points by region
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", linewidth = 1) +  # make the line a loess curve
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::label_number(prefix = "$", suffix = "k")) + # stretch x- axis, add '$' and 'k' to values
  labs(
    x= "GDP per Capita", # x-axis title
    y = "Female Labor Force Participation", # y-axis title
    title = "Wealth and female labor force participation, 1990 - present", # plot title
    caption = "Source: V-Dem Institute", # caption
    color = "Region" # legend title
    )
```

## Color Schemes

Here mention the accessibility checker tools in Windows and OS


## Annotations
