## Academic support

Writing Center GW's Writing Center cultivates confident writers in the
University community by facilitating collaborative, critical, and
inclusive conversations at all stages of the writing process. Working
alongside peer mentors, writers develop strategies to write
independently in academic and public settings. Appointments can be
booked online [here](https://writingcenter.gwu.edu/appointments).

Academic Commons Academic Commons provides tutoring and other academic
support resources to students in many courses. Students can schedule
virtual one-on-one appointments or attend virtual drop-in sessions.

access other academic support resources, or obtain assistance
