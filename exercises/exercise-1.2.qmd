## Code

```{=html}
<script type="module">
await globalThis.webR.evalRVoid(`
download.file(
  'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eteitelbaum/dataviz-summer-2023/main/modules/data/dem_women.csv',
  'dem_women.csv'
)

webr::install(c("dplyr", "readr"))

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
dem_women <- read_csv("dem_women.csv")
`)
</script>	
```

```{webr}
dem_summary <- dem_women |> 
  group_by(region)  |> 
  summarize(
    polyarchy = mean(polyarchy, na.rm = TRUE),
    gdp_pc = mean(gdp_pc, na.rm = TRUE), 
    flfp = mean(flfp, na.rm = TRUE), 
    women_rep = mean(women_rep, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(polyarchy))

```

## Questions

1. Try summarizing the data with a [different function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html#useful-functions) for one or more of the variables. 
  a. What is the median value of `polyarchy` for The West?
  b. What is the max value of `gdp_pc` for Eastern Europe?
  c. What is the standard deviation of `flfp` for Africa?
  d. What is the interquartile range of `women_rep` for the Middle East?

2. Now try grouping by country instead of region. 

  a. What is the median value of `polyarchy` for Sweden?
  b. What is the max value of `gdp_pc` New Zealand?
  c. What is the standard deviation of `flfp` for Spain?
  d. What is the interquartile range of `women_rep` for Germany?

3. Sort countries in descending order based on the mean value of `gdp_pc` (instead of the median value of `polyarchy`). Which country ranks first based on this sorting?

4. Now try sorting countries in ascending order based on the median value of `women_rep` (hint: delete "desc" from the `arrange()` call). Which country ranks at the "top" of the list?
