On the final day of the workshop, we will have a special instructional session by members of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) data visualization team. They will introduced the USAID style guide and
teach students how to utilize the open-source package called glitr to create visualizations in the USAID house style. Through a walkthrough exercise, they will demonstrate how to transform a cluttered and illegible column chart into a visually
appealing visualization that meets the standards for a USAID report.

*Guest Instructors:* Aaron Chafetz (Senior Economist), Timothy Essam (Senior Data Scientist) and Karishma Shrikanth (Data Analyst), United States Agency for International Development. 

*Note:* This session is optional for students enrolled in IAFF 6502. However, I will give EXTRA CREDIT to ALL students who attend!
