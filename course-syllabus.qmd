## Aiming For Success

I care about your learning and also about this subject matter, and I am
here to help you have a meaningful learning experience. I expect you to
take ownership of your learning: you can get more out of the course by
thoughtfully participating in discussions, actively taking notes on
readings and lectures, and giving your best effort overall. I will hold
you to the highest standards for academic honesty and integrity in your
work. I will also encourage you to collaborate and learn from your peers
through thoughtful and respectful discussion. It is recommended you log
in daily order to keep up with course requirements. I must highlight
that communication is vital, so I hope you feel comfortable reaching out
to me if you are struggling or have concerns or need [accommodations
beyond accessibility](#_heading=h.41mghml). We can determine strategies
to set you up for success. Finally, I look forward to collaborating with
you in this course to create a meaningful experience for everyone.

# Policy on AI Tools

**Overview:**

The use of ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for students in this course,
but it is important to use it ethically and appropriately. By following
the guidelines and expectations outlined in this syllabus policy,
students can maximize the benefits of using ChatGPT while also
demonstrating their own critical thinking, research, and programming
skills.

As part of this course, students will have the option to use ChatGPT, a
large language model trained by OpenAI, to assist in the writing of
their R scripts for specific course assignments. ChatGPT can provide
students with a starting point for their code but often the code is
incomplete or error-prone. It is important to recognize that ChatGPT is
a tool and not a substitute for critical thinking, research, or
programming skills. Therefore, this syllabus policy outlines the
guidelines and expectations for using ChatGPT in this course.

**Guidelines:**

Use ChatGPT ethically and honestly. Do not use ChatGPT to plagiarize or
take credit for work that is not your own. Any use of ChatGPT must be
properly cited and referenced in accordance with the university's code
of academic integrity.

Recognize the limitations of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a machine learning
model and may not always provide the most accurate or relevant
information. Therefore, it is important to critically evaluate the
information and verify it with other sources.

Use ChatGPT appropriately. ChatGPT should only be used to assist in
writing boilerplate syntax for this course. It's a starting point. It
should not be used to attempt to complete other assignments or
assessments in this course or in other courses.

## Office Hours

Another way we can work toward your success in the course is through
office/student hours. Please make an appointment to talk with me during

-   Review an assignment you've completed and have questions about
-   Step through practice problems or questions
-   Get study strategies
-   Discuss grades

To make the meeting more effective, you can:

-   Gather materials (assignments, notes, etc.) ready in advance
-   Be ready to take notes during office hours
-   Ask follow up questions if you need clarification
-   Confirm any action plan at the close of the meeting
-   Following through on any action plan

## How You Will Learn and Demonstrate Knowledge

My aim is to provide you opportunities for active learning and skills
development that help you meet course learning objectives and also grow
in your knowledge of this field.

### Instruction

I've designed the following instructional components to support your
learning and growth in the course.

-   **Lecture Videos:** Each week you will be responsible for watching
    or listening to video mini-lectures and/or podcasts. These media
    support provide you essential information in order to complete
    course activities and assessments. Please note that recorded
    lectures and podcasts are not a substitute for required readings.

-   **Tutorial Videos:** Each week you have the opportunity to explore a
    topic further by watching additional videos. These draw on the
    expertise of various organizations or individuals and can be used to
    help you complete activities and assessments.

-   **Readings:** Each week you will be responsible for various reading
    assignments. The readings contain essential content for completing
    the course assignments.

### Assessment

The following assessments help you gauge and demonstrate your progress
in the course and support you in meeting course learning objectives.

    that provide immediate feedback and support ongoing learning.

You'll find support for Blackboard and other tools used for course
activities and assignments under the **Technology Support** link in the
left navigation menu in our course on Blackboard.

## Demonstrating Academic Integrity

All of us in the course will comply with [the GW Code of Academic
Integrity](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/). It states that "we, the
Students, Faculty, Librarians, Staff, and Administration of The George
Washington University, believing academic integrity to be central to the
mission of the University, commit ourselves to promoting high standards
for the integrity of academic work. Commitment to academic integrity
upholds educational equity, development, and dissemination of meaningful
knowledge, and mutual respect that our community values and nurtures.
The George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity is
established to further this commitment."

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including
misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others
without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the
fabrication of information. For details and complete code, see the [Code
of Academic
Integrity.](http://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity)Common
examples of academic dishonesty include cheating, fabrication,
plagiarism, falsification, forgery of University academic documents, and
facilitating academic dishonesty by others. Learn more about avoiding
these:

## Course Communication

Communication in our course is essential; clearing up questions earlier
than later is a good practice, so please don't hesitate to reach out to
me. In any mode of communication used in our course, all of us will
follow [netiquette](#_heading=h.49x2ik5) found in our syllabus.

We will communicate primarily through [GW's Blackboard
System](https://blackboard.gwu.edu) and the Discord server.
Announcements and emails sent through Blackboard automatically go to
your GW email address (i.e., userid\@gwu.edu). Please check your GW
email account on a daily basis or forward your GW email to another
address that you check daily.

I will respond to emails/discussion posts within 48 hours (i.e., "24
hours on weekdays and on the next business day over weekends and
holidays.") I will provide feedback on assignments/exams within 3 days
(i.e., "five days on weekdays and on the next business day over weekends
and holidays.")

You can post general course-related questions to our Discord server.
Please post your question here first rather than emailing me directly if
your question regards the course material. However, if you have a
question that is more personal in nature (i.e., grades), please email me
directly to set up an appointment.

## Netiquette

Behind every name there is a person.

To ensure safe and meaningful learning experiences for everyone, we all
agree to:

-   Remain professional, respectful, and courteous at all times on all
    platforms.
-   Keep in mind this is a college class. Something that would be
    inappropriate in an in-person classroom is also inappropriate in an
    online classroom.
-   When upset, we'll wait a day or two prior to posting. Messages
    posted or emailed in anger are often regretted later.
-   Ask one another for clarification if we find a communication
    offensive or difficult to understand.
-   Avoid sweeping generalizations. Back up our stated opinions with
    facts and reliable sources.
-   Understand that we may disagree and that exposure to other people's
    opinions is part of the learning experience.
-   Just as we would like our privacy respected, we will respect the
    privacy of other course participants and what they share.

I (the instructor) reserve the right to delete any post or communication
in our course that is deemed inappropriate without prior notification to
the student. This includes anything containing language that is
offensive, rude, profane, racist, or hateful. Items that are seriously
off-topic or serve no purpose other than to vent frustration will also
be removed.

Using outside communication apps

I am aware that you and your peers might communicate using tools outside
of GW's Blackboard, my course website, our course Discord channel, or
email systems. Rules of netiquette and appropriate communication extend
to these tools as well as to Blackboard. If you see any tool being used
inappropriately (i.e., any communication containing language that is
offensive, rude, profane, racist, or hateful; uses that promote cheating
of any kind), contact me as soon as possible to speak privately about
it.
